			<h1 class="page-title">Joe Satriani 'The Elephants of Mars'</h1>
			<small class="text-author">By Mike O'Cull</small>
			<p class="page-text">Rock guitar mastermind Joe Satriani bounces back post-pandemic with a new record, The Elephants of Mars, that features
			some of the most compelling songs of his career. The album will be released April 8th, 2022 on the earMUSIC imprint and
			will be available in limited-edition colored vinyl, black vinyl, Digi-pack CD, and digital formats.</p>
			<p class="page-text">The Elephants of Mars is Satriani's 19th studio effort to date and definitively reinforces why he has remained perhaps
			the most popular instrumental rock/shred guitarist out there since the 1980s. His music has always been as much about
			songwriting as it was high-velocity guitar slinging and Satch has continued to refine that internal balance with each
			new release. He's so good at it now that he can hold back at will to create moods and emotions that mesmerize listeners
			before clobbering them with his prodigious chops that are always just below the surface. He sees the big picture of his
			music better than anyone in his genre and that, friends and neighbors, is why he rules.</p>

				Joe Satriani has been at the top of the rock guitar game for over 30 years as a headline solo artist and as part of the
				G3 tours with his former student and fellow shredder Steve Vai. He has sold over ten million records, seen four of his
				titles earn gold record status, and two others make it to platinum. He's also been nominated for an incredible 15 Grammy
				Awards. His exquisite ballad “Always With Me, Always With You,” achieved the impossible and brought instrumental rock
				back to radio in 1987 for the first time since the heyday of bands like The Ventures in the 1960s. Joe also scored with
				his side band Chickenfoot, which featured ex-Van Halen frontman Sammy Hagar, Van Halen bassist Michael Anthony, and Red
				Hot Chili Peppers' drummer Chad Smith. Their debut album was certified gold and their second studio album debuted on the
				charts at Number Nine.
